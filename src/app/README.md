# Project Setup Instructions

## Project Images
Place your project screenshots/images in the `public/projects/` directory with the following names:
- portfolio.png

- weather.png
- ecommerce.png

The images should be:
- High quality (minimum 1200x800 pixels)
- In PNG or JPG format

If you don't have actual project images yet, you can use placeholder images from services like:
